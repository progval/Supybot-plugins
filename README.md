A bunch of plugins for Supybot / Limnoria I wrote myself or found on the
net and improved. Plugins that require HTTPd aren't compatible with 
Supybot nor gribble. If you cannot load these plugins in Limnoria, please 
check that you use recent version with the `version` command.

To install depedencies for Limnoria and these plugins, run

```
pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ProgVal/Limnoria/master/requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
